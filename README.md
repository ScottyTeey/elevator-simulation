# Elevator Simulation Project

## Overview

The Elevator Simulation Project is a console-based simulation of an elevator system implemented in C#. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and SOLID design principles to simulate the efficient movement of elevators within a multi-floor building.

The simulation offers a range of features including:

- Multiple floors and elevators support.
- Weight limit per elevator.
- Tracking elevator status, direction, and current floor.
- Requesting elevators to specific floors.
- Loading passengers into elevators with weight checks.
- Unloading passengers at their desired floors.
- Managing the number of people waiting on each floor.

## Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, make sure you have the following:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/elevator-simulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd elevator-simulation
   ```

3. Build the project.

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the project.

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to interact with the elevator simulation. You can:

1. Call an elevator to a specific floor.
2. Set the number of people waiting on a floor.
3. Quit the simulation.

The simulation will display elevator status, movement, and passenger loading/unloading information.
